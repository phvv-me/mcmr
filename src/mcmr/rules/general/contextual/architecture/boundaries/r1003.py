    """Judge the role of one deterministically nominated dependency hub.

    Definition
    ----------
    Apply only after graph metrics establish a comparable degree outlier. Judge contract
    cohesion, stability across representative changes, consumer-specific knowledge, and a
    deliberate coordination role independently. High degree alone is never a failure.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite graph degrees, focused node relationships, public surface, consumers, and
    representative changes. Whole-repository orientation may locate the hub but cannot prove
    consumer-specific knowledge by itself.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Stable abstractions, facades, application services, and composition roots are useful hubs.

    Examples
    --------
    A small repository protocol many services import is a `stable_abstraction`. A `Manager` class
    carrying unrelated consumer flags and a branch per caller is a `dependency_magnet`. An
    application service deliberately wiring several collaborators is an `intentional_coordinator`,
    and a hub with no evidence about consumer knowledge is `uncertain`.
