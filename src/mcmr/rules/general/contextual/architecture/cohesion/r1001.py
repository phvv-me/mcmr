    Definition
    ----------
    Compare the exact source of every top-level declaration in one module. Mark it `mixed` only
    when at least two declarations implement unrelated domain outcomes. Mark an explicit facade,
    adapter, registry, or composition root `intentional_integration`. Otherwise keep a single
    responsibility as `cohesive` and missing semantic evidence as `uncertain`. `minimum_members`
    keeps very small modules out of this semantic pass.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings retain the model reasoning and the exact declaration records it cited.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Composition roots, facades, adapters, and deliberate integration modules may coordinate
    several systems while retaining one architectural responsibility. A smaller module remains
    excluded unless `minimum_members` is lowered.

    Examples
    --------
    Parsing invoices and sending unrelated email campaigns in one module is `mixed`. A composition
    root wiring both systems is `intentional_integration`.
