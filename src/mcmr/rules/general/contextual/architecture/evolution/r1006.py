    Definition
    ----------
    Combine churn, authorship, complexity, coupling, defects, tests, and current project role.
    High complexity alone or high churn alone does not establish a hotspot. The criteria keep
    change frequency, structural risk, verification, ownership, and transient work independent.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite history windows, structural metrics, defect links, ownership, and test evidence.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Generated sources, migrations, and short-lived coordinated rewrites may be transient.

    Examples
    --------
    A complex pricing module changed weekly with weak mutation results is a `hotspot`. A parser
    changed once for a protocol revision is `stable_complex`. A module that is complex and quiet,
    or busy and simple, is `healthy`, since neither half establishes a hotspot on its own.
