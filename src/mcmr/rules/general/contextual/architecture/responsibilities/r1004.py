    Definition
    ----------
    Compare the exact class source and its independently citable method bodies. Mark it `mixed`
    only when separate method groups implement unrelated domain outcomes. Mark a facade,
    application service, visitor, or composition object `intentional_coordinator` only when its
    supplied source establishes that role. Otherwise use `cohesive` or `uncertain`.
    `minimum_methods` keeps classes with too little surface for a useful comparison out of this
    semantic pass.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite the exact class and method records that establish the responsibility groups.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Facades, application services, and composition objects may intentionally coordinate. A class
    below `minimum_methods` remains excluded unless the setting is lowered.

    Examples
    --------
    A class that prices orders and also renders HTML is `mixed`. A `CheckoutService` coordinating a
    pricing collaborator and a payment collaborator is an `intentional_coordinator`. A class whose
    methods all read one cluster of state is `cohesive`.
