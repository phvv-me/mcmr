    """Judge whether representative behavior changes remain architecturally local.

    Definition
    ----------
    Require representative history and an identified behavior boundary. Separately establish
    repeated unrelated edits, necessary public protocol adoption, and bounded transient work.
    One large commit or one cross-file edit cannot establish scattered change.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite compact graph paths, commit or change-set identifiers, the named behavior,
    and the components touched by each representative change.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Public protocol migrations, generated sources, and migrations with removal plans may spread
    a change intentionally.

    Examples
    --------
    Adding one payment state through six unrelated switches across four packages is `scattered`.
    Updating every generated client after a versioned schema change is an
    `intentional_protocol_change`. A change that stays inside the package owning the behavior is
    `localized`.
