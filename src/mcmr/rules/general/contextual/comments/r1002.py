    """Judge whether a comment remains accurate beside the current system.

    Definition
    ----------
    Compare the normalized comment claim with its bounded preceding and following source. Mark it
    `current` only when that source affirmatively agrees and `stale` only when it affirmatively
    contradicts the claim. Mark clearly labeled rationale about an earlier constraint as
    `historical`. Use `ambiguous` when the claim has several readings and `uncertain` when the
    bounded evidence cannot verify it. Directives, commented-out source, API documentation, and
    comments shorter than `minimum_tokens` are excluded.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite the comment, claimed behavior, contradictory or supporting facts, and history.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Historical rationale may remain useful when clearly marked and still relevant. API
    documentation and comments below `minimum_tokens` stay outside this local implementation
    check.

    Examples
    --------
    A comment saying retries occur three times is `stale` when configuration now allows five. A
    note explaining a protocol workaround remains `current` while that constraint exists.
