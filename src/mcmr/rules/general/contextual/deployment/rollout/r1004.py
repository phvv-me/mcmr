    """Judge whether a deployment has a usable rollback path.

    Definition
    ----------
    Ask the selected judgment backend for five independently cited rollback facts and reduce them
    through a fixed decision table. Compare artifacts, state compatibility, steps, timing, owner
    authority, rehearsal evidence, and material blockers.

    Evidence
    --------
    The frozen bundle cites rollback artifacts, state, timing, owners, rehearsal runs, and
    blockers.
    Missing, duplicate, conflicting, or uncited answers remain `unknown` and reduce to `uncertain`.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    A change with no deployed effect can be `not_required`. An authorized one-way change needs a
    verified recovery path and should be assessed by the migration rules instead.

    Examples
    --------
    A compatible path with an owner and recent timed rehearsal is `ready`. A documented command
    that has never run under representative conditions is `unverified`.
