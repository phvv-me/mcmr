    """Judge whether a function stays at one useful level of abstraction.

    Definition
    ----------
    Compare the function name, orchestration, domain operations, low-level mechanics, and
    extracted helpers. Mixed means a reader must repeatedly switch between policy and mechanism.
    The criteria independently establish a shared intent level, interleaving, repeated switching,
    and a deliberate boundary purpose. Small functions are structurally cohesive enough to skip
    model judgment, so candidates need six statements and four behavior operations.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite the function body, callees, names, and the level assigned to each operation.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Composition roots and small adapters may coordinate levels when the boundary remains obvious.

    Examples
    --------
    `publish_report` that validates policy and also hand-builds HTTP frames is `mixed`. A
    composition root that wires a report service to an HTTP adapter is a `boundary`. A function
    whose every statement names a domain operation is `cohesive`.
