    """Judge whether clients depend on a focused contract.

    Definition
    ----------
    Compare interface members with the subsets used by each client and implemented meaningfully by
    each provider. Small size alone does not establish a focused interface. The criteria
    independently establish client usage, provider support, distinct subsets, split cost, and a
    facade boundary.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite members, client usage matrices, implementations, and candidate contract splits.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    A cohesive facade may expose several operations when clients understand one unified capability.

    Examples
    --------
    A storage protocol forcing read-only clients to implement deletion is `bloated`. Separate read
    and write protocols are `focused` when their clients differ.
