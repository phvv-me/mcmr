    Definition
    ----------
    Compare critical paths, failure modes, diagnostic questions, signals, and ownership. A risk is
    actionable only when the retained signals can answer the questions needed to distinguish its
    likely failure modes without unsafe or indiscriminate collection.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite each risk, its critical path, failure modes, diagnostic questions, signals, and
    owner rather than a provider-supplied actionability verdict.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    A signal may link to richer correlated context elsewhere. Low-risk paths may need fewer signals
    when the reason is explicit and the remaining questions still have reliable answers.

    Examples
    --------
    A payment risk with latency, outcome, dependency, and correlation signals that answer its
    timeout and rejection questions is `actionable`. A risk naming several failures but no signal
    that distinguishes them is `gaps`.
