    """Judge whether an optimization earns its complexity.

    Definition
    ----------
    Compare before and after measurements, workload relevance, correctness, resource tradeoffs,
    readability, and maintenance cost. Missing baseline or profile requires uncertainty.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite benchmark results, profiles, correctness checks, and complexity changes.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Hard resource limits can justify small gains when the constraint and margin are explicit.

    Examples
    --------
    A simpler implementation that cuts peak memory by half is `supported`. A cache added without a
    measured bottleneck is `unsupported` or uncertain.
