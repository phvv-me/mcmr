    """Judge whether a benchmark supports the decision made from it.

    Definition
    ----------
    Compare the decision, workload distribution, data size, environment, warmup, repetitions,
    variance, baseline, resources, end-to-end effects, and recency.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite benchmark code, commands, environments, samples, statistics, and the claimed
    decision.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Focused microbenchmarks are valid for isolated mechanism questions with bounded claims.

    Examples
    --------
    A representative service workload with controlled comparisons is `representative`. Timing one
    parser token and claiming end-to-end speedup is `micro_only`.
