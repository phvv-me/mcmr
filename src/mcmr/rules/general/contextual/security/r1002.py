    Definition
    ----------
    Compare private reporting, scope, ownership, triage, response objectives, advisory creation,
    coordinated disclosure, patch production, release, notification, and retrospective evidence.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite security policy, contacts, owners, objectives, advisory tools, release path, and
    previous response evidence.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Private transient components may inherit a clearly identified parent response process.

    Examples
    --------
    A current private reporting path with an owner and tested advisory-to-release workflow is
    `ready`. A stale email address with no patch owner is `partial` or absent.

    References
    ----------
