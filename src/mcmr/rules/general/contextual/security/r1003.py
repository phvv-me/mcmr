    Definition
    ----------
    Compare in-scope boundaries with their assets, flows, actors, threats, mitigations, residual
    risks, ownership, review age, and any named inherited model. Judge whether the evidence covers
    the actual boundary rather than counting a generic checklist.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite raw boundary and threat evidence, including the owner, review age, and inherited
    model when one supplies the analysis.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    A component may inherit a current parent threat model when the retained evidence names it and
    shows that its boundary is covered. A repository with no meaningful security boundary may be
    `not_required`.

    Examples
    --------
    A current public API model covering assets, trust crossings, actors, abuse paths, mitigations,
    and accepted residual risks is `complete`. A model for an old architecture is `stale` or
    `misaligned` even when every document section exists.
