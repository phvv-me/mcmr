    """Judge whether mutable state has one clear owner.

    Definition
    ----------
    Trace creation, mutation, aliases, exposure, synchronization, persistence, and lifecycle.
    State several holders reach is still `owned` when one explicit governing contract decides
    every write, whether that contract is a lock, a single writer, or a supplied protocol.
    `shared` names state several holders mutate with no such contract to point at, and `leaked`
    names internal state handed out for any caller to edit.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite state declarations, aliases, writers, readers, transitions, and synchronization.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Deliberate shared caches and framework state may be valid with bounded mutation and ownership.

    Examples
    --------
    Returning an internal mutable list that callers edit is `leaked`. An immutable snapshot updated
    through one repository is `owned`.
