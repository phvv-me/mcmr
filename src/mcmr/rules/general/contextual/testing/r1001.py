    Definition
    ----------
    Compare requirements, risks, boundaries, failures, test types, runtime, coverage, and
    mutation evidence. The rule evaluates strategy rather than maximizing test count.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings cite behavior, risk, test, and measurement evidence.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Prototypes and low-risk scripts may accept lighter evidence by explicit policy.

    Examples
    --------
    A payment path tested at its boundaries and on its failure modes is `sufficient`. The same path
    with no failure test is `gaps`. Repeating one pure-function assertion through unit, service,
    and browser layers is `overbuilt`, and testing the framework rather than the behavior is
    `misaligned`.
