    Definition
    ----------
    Classify each substantial comment as `target`, `other`, or `uncertain`. The configured target
    is `target_language`, which defaults to American English. Judge only the natural-language text
    supplied by the comment provider. A directive or commented-out source is not prose. Do not
    guess from a short or ambiguous fragment, a proper name, an identifier, or a code term.

    Evidence
    --------
    Each finding cites the exact comment record, its source range, model confidence, and model
    provenance. `minimum_characters` excludes fragments that language identification models cannot
    distinguish reliably.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Quoted user text, protocol tokens, names, and required foreign terms can remain when the
    surrounding explanation uses the project language. Configure another target for a repository
    whose readers use another language.

    Examples
    --------
    With the default target, `# Retry after the peer closes the socket` is `target`. A substantial
    Japanese explanation is `other`. `# Tokio` is excluded by the length floor.
