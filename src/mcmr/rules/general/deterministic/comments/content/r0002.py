    """Normalize the longest contiguous implementation comment.

    Definition
    ----------
    Consecutive ordinary comment lines form one group, `measure` chooses what a group's size is
    counted in, and the largest group in the file that is not a legal notice is the one measured.
    Documentation comments belong to the prose rules because their job is to explain a public
    contract rather than an implementation decision. That raw size is divided by
    `normalization_max` and stated as a percentage, so a group at or past the normalization maximum
    reads as one hundred and everything shorter scales beneath it.

    A license is left out because it is not a comment about this code. It is the same words in
    every file of the project, put there by policy, and the fifteen-line notice one library opens
    all of its two hundred and six files with made this rule fail every one of them, which tells a
    reader nothing at all. `notice_markers` names what a notice opens with, so a project spelling
    one differently configures it rather than turning the rule off.

    The normalization is what makes the number comparable. A raw token count means nothing across
    two repositories with different comment habits, and a share of an agreed ceiling means the same
    thing in both. The rule states the share and a project policy decides which share is too much,
    since a protocol citation and a restated line of code are the same length and worth very
    different things.

    Evidence
    --------
    The finding names the file and range of the largest ordinary comment group it measured together
    with its raw size in the selected measure. The value is that size as a percentage of
    `normalization_max`, clipped at one hundred.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    A file with no ordinary comment measures zero rather than being skipped, which keeps the value
    comparable across a repository, and so does a file holding only documentation or its license.
    Nothing here judges whether a long implementation comment is worth its length, so a rationale
    and a safety note measure exactly as long as they are. The contextual comment rules say whether
    they earn it.

    Examples
    --------
    A forty-token group under the default two-hundred-token normalization maximum returns `20`. A
    two-hundred-and-fifty-token group returns `100`, since the value is clipped rather than allowed
    past the ceiling. A file whose longest run of comment lines is a single line returns close to
    zero, and one opening with a fifteen-line Apache notice and saying nothing else returns `0`.
