    """Measure resolved dependencies lagging their latest compatible release.

    Definition
    ----------
    Collect current dependency evidence in memory and compare exact release timestamps. Divide
    in-scope dependencies whose latest compatible release is more than
    `maximum_release_lag_days` newer than the resolved release by all in-scope dependencies with
    complete timestamp evidence.

    Evidence
    --------
    Findings retain the declared requirement, exact resolved and compatible versions, resolved
    version age, release lag, artifact location, and stable evidence identifiers. Missing upstream
    facts remain explicit provider failures and do not become maintenance conclusions. The value is
    the percentage of measurable dependencies lagging past the configured window.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    The comparison uses the latest release compatible with the declared requirement. Local, VCS, or
    otherwise unresolved dependencies remain outside the denominator until evidence is known.
    Package maintenance, archival, and deprecation are separate observations. Development
    dependencies stay out of both sides unless `include_development` asks for them, since a lagging
    test tool and a lagging runtime dependency carry very different risk.

    Examples
    --------
    Four dependencies beyond the configured lag among forty measurable dependencies produce `10`.
    A year-old resolved release matching the latest compatible release does not count as lag. The
    value counts what lags rather than what is current, so the bound is a ceiling in the way its
    sibling `ALL-DEPE0004` states one.
