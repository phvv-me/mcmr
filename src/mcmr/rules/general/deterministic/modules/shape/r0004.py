    """Count path components outside ASCII on the way to one source file.

    Definition
    ----------
    Read the repository-relative path of every source file and report each component holding a
    character outside ASCII. The value is the number of such components, so a file named in one
    alphabet under a directory named in another counts twice.

    A path is not read only by the editor that displays it. An archive rewrites it under its own
    encoding, a build system interpolates it into a command line, a container image copies it onto
    a filesystem that normalizes Unicode by different rules, and a shell on another platform quotes
    it by rules nobody remembers. Each of those is a place where a name outside ASCII stops being
    the same name, and the failure surfaces far from the file that caused it.

    Evidence
    --------
    The finding names the file and the language that wrote it. The value counts components rather
    than characters, because a component is the unit a filesystem, an archive, and an import
    statement each address.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    A repository whose readers share one alphabet and whose toolchain is fixed can carry these
    names deliberately, which is a decision to record once rather than a finding to silence per
    file. Content that is not source is not read here, since the rule judges source files.

    Examples
    --------
    Bad
    ~~~
    `src/café/lector.py` reports twice, once for the directory and once for the file.

    Good
    ~~~~
    `src/cafe/reader.py` reads the same everywhere it is written down.
