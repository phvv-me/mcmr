    """Require one primary class at most in each source module.

    Definition
    ----------
    Count classes declared directly at module scope. A source module should normally give one
    primary class a name and a home. A second class usually means that two concepts share one file
    or that a support record has not yet been given a narrower owner.

    Evidence
    --------
    The finding names the module and its exact top-level class count. Nested implementation
    classes do not count. The value is the number of top-level classes.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Type stub modules may declare the complete surface of one native extension, so their classes
    do not represent colocated implementations. Tiny closed type families, generated schemas, and
    language-mandated companion declarations can remain together through an explicit path
    exclusion. A package initializer should export classes from their own modules rather than
    define the family itself.

    Examples
    --------
    A module defining `Reader` and `Writer` returns `2` and fails the standard ceiling. A module
    defining `Reader` with a nested private cursor returns `1`.
