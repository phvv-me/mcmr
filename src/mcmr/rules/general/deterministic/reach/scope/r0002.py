@rule("ALL-REAC0002")
def file_local_public_declaration(subject: Table[SymbolReachFact]) -> CountQuery:
    """Count public declarations only their own file ever uses.

    Definition
    ----------
    Report a public declaration that at least one reference reaches, where every one of those
    references sits in the file that declares it. A name published to the whole repository but
    used in exactly one place is stating a contract it does not have. Making it nonpublic tells a
    reader the truth, and it frees the declaration to change without a repository-wide search.

    This is the ordinary way a module accumulates surface. A helper is written public because
    everything else nearby is public, and nothing ever calls it from outside.

    Evidence
    --------
    Each finding names the declaration, its kind, and how many references its own file makes
    against the nothing every other file makes. The repair is a choice, because a name is either
    an interface nobody adopted yet or a helper that was never meant to be one. The value is the
    number of such declarations.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    A class is never counted, because the one repair this rule offers is a nonpublic name and a
    leading underscore belongs to functions, methods, and variables rather than to a type. A class
    used in one file is named for what it is, and where it is genuinely dead `ALL-REAC0001` says
    so. A module a test runner collects is skipped, since its declarations are reached by name. A
    published API, a framework hook, and a plugin entry point are reached from outside the
    repository, so their reference counts understate them. A declaration a test file reaches is
    reached from another file and is not counted here.

    Examples
    --------
    A public `def parse_header(line)` that only its own module calls returns `1` and should become
    `_parse_header` or move inside its single caller. The same function called from two modules
    returns `0`, and so does a `class HeaderPolicy` its own module is the only reader of.
