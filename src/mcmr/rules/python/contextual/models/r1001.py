    """Recommend a Python foundation for one class.

    Definition
    ----------
    Compare one concrete Python class and its exact source with the house model policy. This pass
    receives only dataclasses, direct Pydantic foundation bypasses, and state-bearing plain classes
    without ordinary behavior. Declarative state uses `use_frozen_model` unless supplied source
    establishes mutation after construction. Arbitrary external field types use the corresponding
    flex category only when supplied annotations establish them. A dataclass is an exception only
    when supplied interoperability or measured performance evidence requires it. Otherwise
    recommend the matching approved model. Every `use_` category asks for the class to move onto
    that foundation, so `use_plain_class` names a class that has to come off a model, while a class
    already sitting on the right foundation is `appropriate` whether that foundation is an approved
    model or a plain class. Missing requirements are `uncertain`.

    Evidence
    --------
    The finding retains the model confidence, class name, and source path.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Framework-owned base classes and external interoperability contracts may constrain
    the available foundation and should be described in the supplied requirements.

    Examples
    --------
    An immutable validated settings dataclass selects `use_frozen_model`. A mutable record holding
    a Torch tensor selects `use_flex_model` only when both facts are supplied. A connection pool
    with lifecycle behavior is `appropriate` as a plain class.
