    """Decide whether a reused model belongs at its consumers' shared boundary.

    Definition
    ----------
    Nominate declarative top-level models with no ordinary behavior when at least the configured
    number of modules import them and the graph can derive a narrower shared destination. Decide
    to move only when the supplied class source, importing modules, and destination establish that
    the type is a reusable contract rather than a concept owned by its current module. Keep it
    when its current module owns the concept. Missing ownership or cycle evidence is uncertain.
    `minimum_importers` sets the required number of distinct importing modules.

    Evidence
    --------
    Each candidate carries the exact class source, current path, proposed destination, field
    count, importing modules, model ancestry, and graph evidence. The model cites the retained
    claims behind its decision. A failing answer is a placement decision rather than a numeric
    threshold violation.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Tests, behavioral services, protocols, models with fewer importers, and models already at the
    derived boundary never reach contextual classification. A domain model may remain beside its
    owner. Any unresolved ownership or dependency cycle stays uncertain.

    Examples
    --------
    A generic `Location` record imported by unrelated adapters can move to their shared models
    boundary. An `OrderLine` imported by several order services remains with the order domain when
    that module owns its invariants.
