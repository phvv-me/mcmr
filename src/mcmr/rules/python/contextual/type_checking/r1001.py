    """Decide which reusable typing declarations belong in a shared module.

    Definition
    ----------
    Group resolved aliases, Protocols, TypedDicts, and typing factories at their narrowest common
    directory. Nominate declarations outside a preferred typing module only when the scope reaches
    all three configured reuse floors. Decide to move only when the declaration is a low dependency
    contract shared by that scope. Keep a declaration beside the runtime concept it describes.
    Missing ownership or cycle evidence is uncertain.
    `minimum_definitions`, `minimum_imported_definitions`, and `minimum_cross_module_imports`
    define those floors. `preferred_modules` names destinations that already satisfy the policy.

    Evidence
    --------
    Every candidate carries its name, exact source range, current module, proposed destination,
    importing modules, and all scope reuse counts. One model turn answers for one declaration, so
    unrelated declarations cannot share a verdict.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Scopes below any configured floor and declarations already in a preferred module never reach
    classification. Domain models, enums, dataclasses, and ordinary runtime classes are not typing
    declarations. A type stays with its owner when moving it would weaken cohesion or make a cycle.

    Examples
    --------
    A generic parsing Protocol imported throughout one package can move to that package's
    `typings.py`. An alias describing the private state of one runtime class stays beside that
    class even when annotations elsewhere mention it.
