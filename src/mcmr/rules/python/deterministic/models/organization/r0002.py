def shared_model_file_shape(
    subject: Table[ClassFact],
) -> CountQuery:
    """Require one model-shaped class in each shared `models` package implementation file.

    Definition
    ----------
    Apply only to Python files directly inside a directory named `models` and exclude
    `__init__.py`. That name is the contract, since a shared model package is a convention a reader
    navigates by, and a package of data models under any other name is left alone. Content then has
    to agree, because a directory counts as a shared model package only when some file inside it
    really declares a data model, so a folder of neural networks named the same way is left alone.
    Require exactly one top-level class deriving a recognized Pydantic, house model, SQL table, or
    decorated dataclass foundation. Enum classes belong in `enums`. Local model groups consumed
    only within one feature package may remain together in that feature's `models.py` instead.

    Evidence
    --------
    A finding lists every top-level class and covers the complete file. Empty utility files,
    multiple model classes, ordinary service classes, and enum classes all violate this shared
    package shape. The value is the number of files in the shared package that do not hold exactly
    one model class.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    `models/__init__.py` may export model classes used outside the package. A feature-local
    `enums.py` inside a nested model package remains governed by the enum placement rules. A rule
    family named `models` is not a shared data-model package. A class reaching a foundation only
    through a project-owned intermediate base is not counted, because the base each file names is
    what one parse can settle. Generated schemas and migration snapshots may be excluded by path.

    Examples
    --------
    Bad
    ~~~
    `models/accounts.py` defines `Account`, `Profile`, and `AccountStatus` together.

    Good
    ~~~~
    `models/account.py` defines only the `Account` Pydantic model. A final generic result model
    derived through a project-owned abstract `RuleResult` is also accepted. `models/__init__.py`
    exports public models when outside consumers need the package API.
