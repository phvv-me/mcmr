) -> CountQuery:
    """Require direct Pydantic models to use an established approved house base.

    Definition
    ----------
    First establish project policy, either by finding a module anywhere in the repository that
    imports a foundation from `patos` or from a `common.bases` module, or by finding a base the
    project itself owns, one declaring no fields that other classes already derive. A module named
    after a folder establishes nothing on its own, since a name says nothing about what a module
    declares. Then inspect project-owned top-level classes and report direct subclasses of an
    imported `pydantic.BaseModel` that do not also inherit an approved base. Resolve direct
    imports, module imports, and aliases through the bindings each file states. Each bypassing
    class contributes one to the result.

    Evidence
    --------
    Each finding identifies the direct model class and its source range. Which foundations count
    as approved is the provider's single project-specific input, and it recognizes the two house
    homes for one. The value is the number of classes deriving `pydantic.BaseModel` without an
    approved foundation.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    Abstain when the project has not established a house foundation. The foundation itself derives
    Pydantic directly by design, so a base owning no fields that states the `model_config` its
    subclasses inherit is never reported, whatever file or folder holds it. Ignore Pydantic
    dataclasses, `RootModel`, dynamic `create_model` calls, unresolved bases, nested classes, and
    subclasses of a project foundation because their Pydantic ancestry is not locally proven. The
    repository's Git ignore files decide whether generated and vendored sources are in the scan,
    and per-rule globs can narrow it further.

    Examples
    --------
    Bad
    ~~~
    After `from patos import FrozenModel` establishes the policy, this direct foundation bypasses
    it.

    .. code-block:: python

       from pydantic import BaseModel

       class User(BaseModel):
           name: str

    Good
    ~~~~
    The project-owned foundation makes mutability and validation policy explicit.

    .. code-block:: python

       from patos import FrozenModel

       class User(FrozenModel):
           name: str
