    """Count source references exposed to explicitly unhealthy data dependencies.

    Definition
    ----------
    For each resolved source reference, read the health the provider recorded for every asset
    upstream of the one this code reads, and count each pair of a source reference and an unhealthy
    upstream asset once. Code that reads a healthy table fed by a broken one is producing wrong
    answers with no error anywhere, which is the failure mode a schema check cannot see and a
    freshness alert on the wrong asset will not raise.

    Unknown health stays unknown. An asset nobody measured is not evidence of a problem, and
    treating it as one would make the count grow with the size of the lineage graph rather than
    with the number of real failures.

    Evidence
    --------
    Each finding names the source reference and the upstream asset whose retained quality evidence
    failed. The value is the number of source reference and unhealthy upstream pairs.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    An upstream asset marked `healthy` or `unknown` is never counted, so a lineage graph with no
    quality evidence at all reports nothing rather than everything. A reference whose own asset the
    catalog does not hold is skipped, since `ALL-DATA0001` owns it and its upstream lineage is
    unknowable. One unhealthy asset feeding four source references is reported four times on
    purpose, because each of those four places is a separate reader producing a wrong answer.

    Examples
    --------
    A source reference whose upstream map records one asset `unhealthy` and another `unknown`
    returns `1`. Two source references reading that same asset return `1` each. A reference whose
    upstream assets are all `healthy` or all `unknown` returns `0`.
