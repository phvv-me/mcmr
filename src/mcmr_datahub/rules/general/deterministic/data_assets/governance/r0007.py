    """Count governed assets missing an owner or required domain.

    Definition
    ----------
    Report each governed asset that names no owner, or that names no domain when `domain` is
    `"required"`. An asset with no owner has nobody to ask when its numbers look wrong and nobody
    to tell when it has to change, and a domain is what says which part of the business its numbers
    are about. Both are cheap to state at creation and expensive to reconstruct years later.

    The `"changed"` scope keeps the default judgment on the assets this change created or modified.
    A project adopting the rule is asked about the work in front of it rather than about its whole
    history. The `"all"` scope measures the entire catalog, which is worth taking as a baseline.

    Evidence
    --------
    Each finding names the asset and the governance fields it leaves empty. The value is the number
    of assets missing an owner or a required domain.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    An unchanged asset is excluded by default, which is what makes the rule adoptable on a catalog
    that predates it. A domain is only required when `domain` is `"required"`, since some catalogs
    model that dimension elsewhere. A whitespace-only domain reads as absent on purpose, because a
    field filled with a space satisfies a schema and answers nobody.

    Examples
    --------
    A newly created asset naming a domain and no owner returns `1`. A changed asset naming both
    returns `0`. An unchanged asset naming neither returns `0` by default and `1` under
    `scope="all"`. With `domain="optional"`, a changed asset naming an owner and no domain returns
    `0`.
